## May 2, 2026 (Pre-config update announcement)  
 - I'll be working on the configs this week. For those who still don't know yet, the ```r.MobileContentScaleFactor``` and the gameviewport were recently included in the forbidden cvars list, which greatly affects the performance and graphics outlook of all configs in this repository.  
 - Config Update Order: Stable-Performance-HighVisual
 - Sui touche`d grasseoux  

## April 19, 2026 (Small, Optional Patch)  
1. Added MAGT to Mediatek Devices  
2. Adapted to KuroFI for StableConfigs  
> Ver 3.3 looks pretty heavy given the new environmental interactions, goodluck to us  

> Important Note: . If you are using **STABLE CONFIG** , the DeviceProfiles.ini may cause blinking.  
    > > To fix this, you may opt to do any of these steps:  
    > > > 1. Delete the DeviceProfiles.ini and just use the Engine.ini  
    > > - I have made the necessary adjustments should that be the case so you're not actually missing out the essential cvars  
    > > > 2. Perform an optimization on your DeviceProfiles.ini as done in this video:  
    > > > https://youtu.be/gtmyFKGyl1M?si=JcctXJ_e9t18St0u  

-----------------------------------------------
> If my configs don't work for you, don't worry. There are a lot of other people and groups who create mobile configs for WuWa now. You can try until you find the best one for you. ***Or better yet***, tweak your own custom config :DDD.  

> For those who want to tweak their own configs,  
> this is the main reference: [UE Console Variable List](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/unreal-engine-console-variables-reference)  
> another reference: [UE4.26 CVars List](https://framedsc.com/GeneralGuides/ue4_commands.htm)  

Lastly, for those who use AI in their configs, I would recommend using Claude  
   > Also make sure your configs' cvars are "real" and "registered". Always check your Client.Log files! AI hallucination is real.
